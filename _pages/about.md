<p>Hi there! Welcome to my little corner of the internet :))</p>
<p>This website began as a way to share knowledge and insights about my career. Around 2008, it was an active portal where I shared daily learnings and activities related to my life. However, over time, something was lost. Now, I would like to reintroduce you to everything that happens behind the scenes.</p>
<p>. . .</p>

<p>Let me introduce you to some important context.</p>
<p>The term <strong>Coding4Fun</strong> <i>(coding for fun)</i> means a form of connotation to express someone's feeling that develop software for fun. Dedicating a good part of their free time to the simple practice of writing source code out of a passion for what their do, besides of course, being the profession of several people. The intention here is to demonstrate that there is a wider world, which is the love for technology and the creation of software projects that help people around the world in some way.</p>
<p>Have you ever stopped to think about the number of hours that developers and architects spend in front of their computers, implementing software and writing content related to the world of technology? This type of work provides constant challenges and many opportunities for growth over time. Why not combine work with fun? For those who breathe technology, their aspirations go beyond simple work. Everything in their lives, perhaps since childhood, can be motivated by the fields of science or computer science. They are perpetually curious individuals.</p>

<p><i>“Coding4Fun running through your veins, my dear!”.</i> We are driven by fun and constant challenges, as our days are filled with enjoyment, problem-solving, and knowledge sharing. Despite the occasional difficulties faced in software projects, we are fortunate and happy to do what we love every day.</p>

<p>My name is Ryan Padilha, and this is my daily diary of work in progress.</p>
<p>As an accomplished professional with over 16 years of experience, I am highly motivated with a strong sense of ownership, a hands-on approach, and a results-oriented leadership style that thrives on challenges. I have a proven track record of achieving significant results and a deep understanding of digital transformation through modern technology and cloud computing.</p>
<p>I have an unwavering passion for research and development, problem-solving, and helping others. My background is rooted in high-performance teams, and I am driven to exceed quarterly goals. I constantly pursue opportunities for professional growth and remain dedicated to staying updated with the latest industry trends and developments.</p>

<p>On a personal note, I love to travel and connect with nature. My interests go beyond software development to include playing with my cat, working out at the gym, swimming at the beach, trekking, enjoying meals at good restaurants, and meeting new people. I'm passionate about reading books on a wide range of subjects: human behavior, psychology, philosophy, Buddhism, science fiction, administration, business, marketing, education, and technology.</p>
