First of all, I want to share my knowledge and expand my horizons by writing.

If you don’t know, the person who’s writing is a Brazilian guy, who was born between books and technology, my first tech course was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_3.1" target="_blank">Microsoft Windows 3.11</a> with Logo (programming logic for kids). My first dream at this time was working at Microsoft, developing and building the next generations of Operational Systems. Can you wonder, a nine-year-old kid that had a dream to work on the major big tech in the world?

After a while, <a href="http://www.slackware.com/" target="_blank">Slackware Linux</a> arose out and was loved at first view, it was the first time that I had the opportunity to understand in deep how an operational system works. I learned how to configure the Kernel, to compile internal drivers such as video, modem, keyboard, mouse, and so on; I played a lot with graphical interfaces like Gnome and KDE, until the time I developed my first website <i>“nerdoze.org”</i> running on Apache with browser Netscape using a 56k Internet modem connection.

Right now, I’m on the cloud computing journey.

Writing here, it’s a good point not only to share my knowledge but also a way to express my personal opinion, my recent thoughts, and my culture, and open a path to people who want to grow in their careers, contributing to my two cents their concepts about technology.
