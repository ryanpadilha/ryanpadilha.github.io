First and foremost, I want to share my knowledge and broaden my horizons through writing.

If you don’t know, the person writing this is a Brazilian guy who was born surrounded by books and technology. My first tech course was on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_3.1" target="_blank">Microsoft Windows 3.11</a> with Logo, which taught programming logic for kids. At that time, my first dream at this time was to work at Microsoft, developing and building the next generations of operating systems. Can you imagine a nine-year-old kid with a dream to work at one of the major big tech companies in the world?

After a while, <a href="http://www.slackware.com/" target="_blank">Slackware Linux</a> came into my life, and it was love at first sight. It was my first deep dive into understanding how an operating system works. I learned how to configure the kernel and compile internal drivers such as video, modem, keyboard, and mouse. I explored graphical interfaces like Gnome and KDE, and eventually developed my first website, <i>“nerdoze.org”</i> hosted on Apache, accessed via Netscape browser over a 56k Internet modem connection.

Right now, I’m on the cloud computing journey.

Writing here serves not only as a platform to share my knowledge but also as a means to express my personal opinions, recent thoughts, and culture. It also opens a path for those who wish to advance in their careers, allowing them to contribute their perspectives on technology.

Here we are, welcome. I hope you enjoy the content!
